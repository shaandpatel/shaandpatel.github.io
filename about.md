During my PhD, I specialized in exoplanetary systems research at the University of Texas at Arlington, where I investigated the the dynamics and habitability of worlds beyond our Solar System. With a strong foundation in computational modeling and ML, I am eager to leverage my strong analytical abilities, passion for data-driven approaches, and scientific expertise to pursue opportunities where I can apply these strengths to tackle complex challenges and drive impactful results.
