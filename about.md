I am a Ph.D. candidate specializing in exoplanetary systems research at the University of Texas at Arlington, where I investigate the the dynamics and habitability of worlds beyond our Solar System. With a strong foundation in astrophysics and computational modeling, Iâ€™m passionate about uncovering the secrets of distant planetary systems. As I near the completion of my degree, I am eager to leverage my strong analytical abilities, passion for data-driven approaches, and scientific expertise to pursue opportunities where I can apply these strengths to tackle complex challenges and drive impactful results.
