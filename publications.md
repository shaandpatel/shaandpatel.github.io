### <u>First-Author Publications<u>
#### [Tidally Torn: Why the Most Common Stars May Lack Large, Habitable-Zone Moons](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03625v1)
*Astronomical Journal*, 2025  
- Explored large moons around M-dwarf HZ planets and found they become unstable on short timescales.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
#### [Can Moons Exist around the Habitable-zone Planet K2-18b?](https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article/542/1/L144/8205638)
*MNRAS Letters*, 2025  
- Ran 2,400 N-body simulations showing exomoons around K2-18b would be ejected within ~10 Myr due to rapid tidal migration.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### [Orbital Stability of Hierarchical 3 and 4-Body Systems with Inclination: Results for Kepler-1625, 1708, and HD 23079](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/537/3/2291/7973016)
*MNRAS*, 2025  
- Simulated (1) exomoon systems to confirm orbital stability of candidates and (2) putative submoons to lay theoretical foundation for future observations.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### [Statistics and Habitability of F-tpye Star—Planet Systems](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ad65eb)
*Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series*, 2024  
- Investigated known F-type systems with planets to find those that are in the habitable zone.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### <u>First-Author Research Notes<u>
#### [Apparent Diameters of F- to M-type Main-sequence Stars as Viewed from Habitable Zone Planets](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/adb036)
*RNAAS*, 2025  
- Investigated the apparent sizes of host stars from different planet locations

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### <u>Co-Author Publications<u>
#### [On the age and metallicity of planet-hosting triple star systems](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10509-024-04351-1)
*Astrophysics and Space Science*, 2024  
- Obtained data from the literature on known planet-hosting triple stellar systems

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### [An Early Catalog of Planet Hosting Multiple Star Systems of Order Three and Higher](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac9302)
*Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series*, 2022   
- Made plots and was co-author on a ApJS paper discussing triple/quadruple star systems
