### <u>First-Author Publications<u>
#### [Can Moons Exist around the Habitable-zone Planet K2-18b?](https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article/542/1/L144/8205638)
*MNRAS Letters*, 2025  
> Ran 2,400 N-body simulations showing exomoons around K2-18b would be ejected within ~10 Myr due to rapid tidal migration.

#### [Orbital Stability of Hierarchical 3 and 4-Body Systems with Inclination: Results for Kepler-1625, 1708, and HD 23079](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/537/3/2291/7973016)
*MNRAS*, 2025  
> Simulated (1) exomoon systems to confirm orbital stability of candidates and (2) putative submoons to lay theoretical foundation for future observations.

#### [Statistics and Habitability of F-tpye Starâ€”Planet Systems](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ad65eb)
*Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series*, 2024  
> Investigated known F-type systems with planets to find those that are in the habitable zone.
