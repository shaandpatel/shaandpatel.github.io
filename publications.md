##### First-Author Publications
#### [Can Moons Exist around the Habitable-zone Planet K2-18b?](#)
*MNRAS Letters*, 2025  
> Ran 2,400 N-body simulations showing exomoons around K2-18b would be ejected within ~10 Myr due to rapid tidal migration.

#### [Orbital Stability of Hierarchical 3 and 4-Body Systems with Inclination: Results for Kepler-1625, 1708, and HD 23079](#)
*MNRAS*, 2025  
> Simulated (1) exomoon systems to confirm orbital stability of candidates and (2) putative submoons to lay theoretical foundation for future observations.

#### [Statistics and Habitability of F-tpye Starâ€”Planet Systems](#)
*Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series*, 2024  
> Investigated known F-type systems with planets to find those that are in the habitable zone.

##### First-Author Research Notes
#### [Apparent Diameters of F- to M-type Main-sequence Stars as Viewed from Habitable Zone Planets](#)
*RNAAS*, 2025  
> Investigated the apparent sizes of host stars from different planet locations

##### Co-Author Publications
#### [On the age and metallicity of planet-hosting triple star systems](#)
*Astrophysics and Space Science*, 2024  
> Obtained data from the literature on known planet-hosting triple stellar systems

#### [An Early Catalog of Planet Hosting Multiple Star Systems of Order Three and Higher](#)
*Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series*, 2022   
> Made plots and was co-author on a ApJS paper discussing triple/quadruple star systems
